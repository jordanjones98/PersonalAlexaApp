# PersonalAlexaApp
This is my Alexa app that I am making for myself mostly for things that I ask
Alexa in the morning, such as weather, commute time, and maybe even reading my
emails or texts? It is mostly just for me to play around.

## What this is for
I got an Amazon Alexa about a year ago, and have recently been playing around with
making skills. The first one I made tells me if I should wear a jacket, but the
API is pretty unreliable. I am going to work on finding API's that are stable,
and ones that I want to play around with. The skill is hosted on AWS Lambda, and
the link is below. For now this is all going to go into one skill
and if something is super cool then I will put it into a separate skill.

## Skill link
Coming soon!
